The statement that the well-being of a society may be enhanced by many of its people questioning authority may immediately seem ludicrous or even anachist, though there are several arguments that may prove this statement to actually be accurate. 

Humans do not lend themselves well to being mandated what they can and can not do. In fact, it is a common assumption that humans seek to defy authority. The want and need to be listened to has created many revolutions throughout history and has helped shape the world into what it is today. 

One may initally assume that those people in a society who have authority over others always have the people's best interests in mind. While in some societies this may be the case, this is not a safe assumption. Therefore, it is always important that the people of a society question authority in an attempt to enhance their well being and receive the rights they deserve. 

An example of questioning authority that hits particularly close to home is the American Revolution. When inhabitants in America were forced by Great Britian to pay extravagant taxes, they felt that they were not being treated fairly. Therefore, in an attempt to defy those who held authority over them they revolted and successfully became their own, independent nation. In becoming their own nation, the United States quality of live was greatly enhanced and in turn has become one of the most successful socieities in history.

While questioning authority may initially have negotive connotations, it is important to pry deeper into the issue. The people of a society are its most important element, thereforein order to enhance their well-being for them to question those in power and in turn receieve what they deserve.
