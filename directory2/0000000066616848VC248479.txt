Executing firms has every right to hire whomever they believe would  bring the best results to their companies. However, if executive firms decide to follow this study, firms should create extra efforts to alleviate their employees' uneasiness. Programs should be intalled to help relaxation and easiness for future employees, so they can produce the highest profit they can achieve. Firms should never be complacement of thier employees feelings and should create  the best atmosphere theat would cause the employee to stress.
	Nonetheless,  I have inquiries about this study. First, the study only had 300 male and female executives. 300 is a very smaill sample size in my opinion, and absolutely does not represent the vast majority of advertising executives. Just because that specific sample size had less than six hours of sleep to become successful, does not mean the majority should follow. I find this study flawed, when we have been told from medical professionals that eights hours of sleep is utmost desired. As the saying goes," different strokes for different folks." While we also are in the topic about the medial professionals, did any participate in this study, reviewed it and deemed it acceptable?
	Also, how would executive employers should know how many hours of sleep per night future exucutives had? Would they base their employment off of that? Is that even legal to even ask? How is absolutely relevant when the prospective employee's resume has their credentials listed? 
	All in all, this study would raise some eyebrows of people questioning its validity. If executive firms decide to follow this study, then they should be prepared of the consequences of not taking care of their employees first instead of the profit.
