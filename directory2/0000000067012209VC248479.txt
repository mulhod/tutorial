The recommendation resulting from the study presents a logical fallacy. Without further information it would be short-sited to argue that a lower sleep requirment has a direct effect on the success of an advertising firm.

The study simply suggests a relationship. It does not identify, or claim to identify, the determning factor of a firm's success. In fact, the need for less sleep may be one of a number of characteristics the executives have in common. Characteristics that carry far more weight in contributing to the success of their firms. Intelligence, drive, leadership, and personal responsiblity may weigh far more heavily in predicting the success of a firm based on personal characteristics.

The recommendation that businesses hire people who need little sleep ignores the fact that a potential candidate who satisfies that requirment may lack characteristics that may be far more important in guding a firm to success.

While the relationship between sleep requirement and a firm's success is interesting, it may simply be incidental. A far more useful study would rate executives based on a number of factors including educational background, age, leadership style, etc.
