While this reported study found a relationship between hours slept per night by executives and the success of their advertising firms, there are more questions to be answered and a need for further investigation before relying on their recommendation of hiring only people who need less than six hours of sleep per night. Further background information of the study and the executives who participated in this study is necessary to truly understand the relationship between sleep and success. Without this information unknown variables could be interfering with the outcome of the study. 
	The first question should be the basic "who, what, when, where, why and how". We are given that the participants are male and female advertising executives, and that it is a recent study. The reader does not know where these participants are from, how they were chosen, why they chose to participate, or what the study consisted of. By understanding the location one learns more about the potential external influences on their sleeping patterns. How they were chosen, can show how the study was set up. And uncovering the incentive behind their reason for participating can reflect the objectivity of the data. Based on the article, the reader knows that the study was looking for sleep patterns, but we don't know how the data was collected. Knowing this could reveal potential flaws in the study.
	The article does not give enough information for the recommendation to be accepted. The study is not described in depth, and the potential for external influences to have disrupted the data is high, without further knowledge of how the study was conducted and how the executives live their lives. Sleep could be one factor of many of why their firms are significantly more successful.
